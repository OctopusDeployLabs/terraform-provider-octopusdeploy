On 1 June 2025, the Octopus Deploy Terraform Provider was promoted from a `Labs` project to a fully-supported, first-class Octopus Deploy integration.

As part of this promotion, we released [v1.0 of the provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/OctopusDeploy/octopusdeploy/1.0.0), and migrated the codebase from the `OctopusDeployLabs` GitHub organization to the `OctopusDeploy` organization. The provider also moved in the Hashicorp Terraform Registry.

* New Repository: https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/terraform-provider-octopusdeploy
* New Provider Registry Page: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/OctopusDeploy/octopusdeploy/latest/docs
* Migration Guide: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/OctopusDeploy/octopusdeploy/1.0.0/docs/guides/moving-from-octopus-deploy-labs-namespace

We are no longer accepting contributions or issues in this repo, and we plan to archive it.

Please head over to the new repository for continued support, updates and contributions.
