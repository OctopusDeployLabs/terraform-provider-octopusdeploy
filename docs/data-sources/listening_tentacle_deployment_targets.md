# octopusdeploy_listening_tentacle_deployment_targets (Data Source)

Provides information about existing listening tentacle deployment targets.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  # deployment_id   = "Deployments-123"
  # environments    = ["Environments-123", "Environments-321"]
  # health_statuses = ["HasWarnings"]
  # ids             = ["Machines-123", "Machines-321"]
  # is_disabled     = false
  # name            = "Listening Tentacle (OK to Delete)"
  # partial_name    = "Listening Tentac"
  # roles           = ["Roles-123", "Roles-321"]
  # shell_names     = []
  # skip            = 5
  # take            = 100
