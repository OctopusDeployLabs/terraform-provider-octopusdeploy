# octopusdeploy Provider

## Warning

This provider is under active development. Its functionalty can and will change; it is a `v0.*` product until its robustness can be assured. Please be aware that types like resources can and will be modified over time. It is strongly recommended to `validate` and `plan` configuration prior to committing changes via `apply`.

## Overview

This provider is used to configure resources in Octopus Deploy. The provider must be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Configuration

### Default Space

Octopus Deploy supports the concept of a Default Space. This is the first space that is automatically created on server setup. If you do not specify a Space when configuring the Octopus Deploy Terraform provider it will use the Default Space.

```terraform
provider "octopusdeploy" {
  address = "https://octopus.example.com"
  api_key = "API-XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

### Scoped to a specific Space

You can configure the Terraform Provider for Octopus Deploy to target a
particular space. If this configuration is specified, resources managed by the
provider will be scoped to this space. To scope the provider to a space, simply
provide the _ID_ of the space.

Scoping the provider by the ID of a space is done as follows:

```terraform
provider "octopusdeploy" {
  address  = "https://octopus.example.com"
  api_key  = "API-XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  space_id = "Spaces-321" # the ID of the space
}
```

### Multiple Spaces

To manage resources in multiple spaces you can specify the space_id on the resource directly:

```terraform
provider "octopusdeploy" {
  address = "https://octopus.example.com"
  api_key = "API-XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

data "octopusdeploy_space" "dev" {
  name     = "Product Development"
}

/*
This resource will use the default space
*/
resource "octopusdeploy_environment" "development-environment" {
  name = "TestEnv1"
}


/*
This resource will be scoped to the space named "Product Development".
*/
resource "octopusdeploy_environment" "Env3" {
  space_id = data.octopusdeploy_space.dev.id
  name     = "TestEnv3"
}
```
