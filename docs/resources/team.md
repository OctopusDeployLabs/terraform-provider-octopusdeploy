# octopusdeploy_team (Resource)

This resource manages teams in Octopus Deploy.

~> **NOTE on Team User Roles and Scoped User Roles:** We currently
provides both a standalone [Scoped User Role resource](scoped_user_role.html)
and a Team resource with `user_roles` blocks defined in-line. At this time you 
cannot use a Team with in-line user_roles in conjunction with any Scoped User Role 
resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of user role settings and will overwrite 
user roles.

## Example Usage

### External security group
```terraform
data "octopusdeploy_space" "space" {
  name = "default"
}

data "octopusdeploy_user_roles" "project_deployer" {
  partial_name = "Project Deployer"
  take         = 1
}

resource "octopusdeploy_team" "example" {
  name = "Example Team"

  external_security_group {
    display_name        = "My Deployment team"
    id                  = "MyDeploymentteam"
  }

  user_role {
    user_role_id = data.octopusdeploy_user_roles.project_deployer.user_roles[0].id
    space_id     = data.octopusdeploy_space.space.id
  }
}
```
