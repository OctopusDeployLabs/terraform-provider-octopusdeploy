# octopusdeploy_project_auto_create_release (Resource)

This resource manages automatic release creation for a project using built-in package repository feeds. When enabled, new releases will be automatically created when new versions of the specified packages are available.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get the built-in feed
data "octopusdeploy_feeds" "built_in" {
  feed_type = "BuiltIn"
  take      = 1
}

# Project with deployment process
resource "octopusdeploy_project" "example" {
  description      = "Example project"
  lifecycle_id     = octopusdeploy_lifecycle.example.id
  name             = "Example Project"
  project_group_id = octopusdeploy_project_group.example.id
}

resource "octopusdeploy_channel" "default" {
  description  = "Default channel"
  lifecycle_id = octopusdeploy_lifecycle.example.id
  name         = "Default"
  project_id   = octopusdeploy_project.example.id
}

# Deployment process with built-in package
resource "octopusdeploy_deployment_process" "example" {
  project_id = octopusdeploy_project.example.id

  step {
    name                = "Deploy Package"
    package_requirement = "LetOctopusDecide"
    
    action {
      action_type = "Octopus.TentaclePackage"
      name        = "Deploy Package Action"
      
      package {
        name             = "MyApp"
        package_id       = "MyApp"
        feed_id          = data.octopusdeploy_feeds.built_in.feeds[0].id
        acquisition_location = "Server"
      }
    }
  }
}

# Configure auto create release
resource "octopusdeploy_project_auto_create_release" "example" {
  project_id = octopusdeploy_project.example.id
  channel_id = octopusdeploy_channel.default.id
  
  release_creation_package {
    deployment_action = octopusdeploy_deployment_process.example.step[0].action[0].name
    package_reference = octopusdeploy_deployment_process.example.step[0].action[0].package[0].name
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `channel_id` (String) The ID of the channel in which triggered releases will be created.
- `project_id` (String) The ID of the project for which to enable automatic release creation.
- `release_creation_package` (Block List) Configuration for the package that will trigger automatic release creation. The package must use a built-in package repository feed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--release_creation_package))

### Optional

- `release_creation_package_step_id` (String) The ID of the deployment step containing the package for release creation. If not specified, it will be automatically determined from the deployment process.
- `space_id` (String) The space ID where the project is located. If not specified, the default space will be used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--release_creation_package"></a>
### Nested Schema for `release_creation_package`

#### Required:

- `deployment_action` (String) The name of the deployment action that contains the package reference.
- `package_reference` (String) The name of the package reference within the deployment action.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import octopusdeploy_project_auto_create_release.example project_id
```

## Notes

- This resource manages project `auto_create_release` settings that were previously managed by the deprecated `auto_create_release` and `release_creation_strategy` attributes on the `octopusdeploy_project` resource. It must not be used together with these attributes.
- The specified package must use a built-in package repository feed (`feeds-builtin`). Other feed types are not supported by this resource.
- The deployment action and package reference must exist in the project's deployment process before creating this resource.
- When this resource is destroyed, automatic release creation will be disabled for the project.
