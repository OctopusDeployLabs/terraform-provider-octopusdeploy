# octopusdeploy_deployment_freeze (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# basic freeze with single environment
resource "octopusdeploy_deployment_freeze" "freeze" {
  name = "Xmas"
  start = "2024-12-25T00:00:00+10:00"
  end = "2024-12-27T00:00:00+08:00"

  project_environment_scope = {
    "Projects-123" = [ "Environments-123" ]
  }
}

# Freeze with different timezones
resource "octopusdeploy_deployment_freeze" "freeze" {
  name = "Xmas"
  start = "2024-12-25T00:00:00+10:00"
  end = "2024-12-27T00:00:00+08:00"

  project_environment_scope = {
    "Projects-123" = [ "Environments-123", "Environments-456" ]
  }
}

# Freeze with ids sourced from resources and datasources. Projects can be sourced from different spaces, a single scope can only reference projects and environments from the same space.
resource "octopusdeploy_deployment_freeze" "freeze" {
  name = "End of financial year shutdown"
  start = "2025-06-30T00:00:00+10:00"
  end = "2025-07-02T00:00:00+10:00"

  project_environment_scope = {
    "${resource.octopusdeploy_project.project1.id}" = [ resource.octopusdeploy_environment.production.id ]
    "${data.octopusdeploy_projects.second_project.projects[0].id}" = [ data.octopusdeploy_environments.default_environment.environments[0].id ]
  }
}
