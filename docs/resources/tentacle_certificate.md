# octopusdeploy_tentacle_certificate (Resource)

Generates a X.509 self-signed certificate for use with a Octopus Deploy Tentacle.

## Octopus certificates
The X.509 certificates generated are self-signed, 2048-bit private keys and intended for use [only between Octopus Server and Tentacle](https://octopus.com/docs/security/octopus-tentacle-communication#Octopus-Tentaclecommunication-Octopuscertificates) communications. There is an insightful discussion of [why Octopus uses self-signed certificates](https://octopus.com/blog/why-self-signed-certificates) by default.

Instead of generating a new certificate through this resource you can use an existing certificate and simply reference the appropriate thumbprint when registering the target.

### State Persistence
This resource that is generated will be stored in the state file and cannot be retrieved later from the external Octopus Server or Tentacle.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "octopusdeploy_tentacle_certificate" "example" {}

resource "octopusdeploy_tentacle_certificate" "example_with_dependencies" {
  dependencies = {
    "target" = octopusdeploy_kubernetes_agent_deployment_target.agent.id
  }
}

# Usage
resource "octopusdeploy_kubernetes_agent_deployment_target" "agent" {
  name         = "agent"
  environments = ["environments-1"]
  roles        = ["role-1", "role-2"]
  thumbprint   = octopusdeploy_tentacle_certificate.example_with_dependencies.thumbprint
  uri          = "poll://kcxzcv2fpsxkn6tk9u6d/"
}
```
